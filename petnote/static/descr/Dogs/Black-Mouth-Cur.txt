Energetic, fearless, and strong, the Black Mouth Cur is valued as an all-around working dog bred to help farmers and hunters in the rugged terrain of the southeastern United States.
The breed is capable of herding livestock, providing protection for the home, and tracking game, though it also has a sensitive side that doesn’t respond well to harsh rebukes or punishment.
The Black Mouth Cur loves being around humans and family, and it is excellent with children, though high exercise needs make this breed a poor choice for inexperienced owners or those who are unable to keep up with a demanding energy level, and its tendency to play rough may not be best for children that are very young.
Black Mouth Curs are mostly found in the United States and are a bit rare in other parts of the world. If you’re interested in bringing home one of these strong-yet-sensitive, energetic, family-friendly dogs, check out our adoption page where you can search for adoptable dogs near you by breed.
The Black Mouth Cur requires an experienced owner with a Goldilocks approach to training. Owners must be firm, but not overly punitive or harsh to find a balance that is just right. These dogs have high exercise needs and do best with a large yard where they can run in addition to being provided with at least one long walk per day, lest they become bored and destructive in the home. They interact well with people and other dogs, though they are highly territorial and may respond aggressively to perceived intruders or threats to their family. It is important to start socialization training early to make sure Black Mouth Curs behave and remain non-aggressive.
