The German Shepherd Dog is one of America’s most popular dog breeds—for good reason. They’re intelligent and capable working dogs. Their devotion and courage are unmatched. And they’re amazingly versatile, excelling at most anything they’re trained to do: guide and assistance work for the handicapped, police and military service, herding, search and rescue, drug detection, competitive obedience, and–last but not least–faithful companion.
The German Shepherd Dog, also known as the Alsatian in Great Britain and parts of Europe, is among the top 10 most popular dog breeds in the U.S., and probably one of the world's most recognized breeds.
The German Shepherd may embody some of the best traits of dogs, but they're not for everyone. Originally bred to herd flocks all day, this is a high-energy dog who needs a lot of activity and exercise. Without it, they're likely to express their boredom and frustration in ways you don't like, such as barking and chewing.
The breed also has an aloof and sometimes suspicious nature—great for a watchdog, but not the sort of family dog who'll make guests feel welcome. However, if you expose a German Shepherd to many different situations and people starting in puppyhood, they can learn to take new people and circumstances in stride.
