This lively, spirited dog breed is a true terrier. Bred in Manchester, England, for the common man’s sports of rat killing and rabbit coursing, he’s got game and he loves to show it. The Gentleman’s Terrier (as he is known in Victorian England) is not a sparring dog but loves a good chase, making him a flyball and agility rock star.
Though his looks suggest a miniature Doberman Pinscher or a large Miniature Pinscher, the Manchester Terrier is his own canine. A wee dog with a strong bark, he’s got personality to burn: loyal, hearty, and a terrific watchdog who adores hanging out with his people. Among terriers, the Manchester is known to be one of the more well-mannered and responsive breeds and today spends his time as a terrific companion who can hold up his end of the conversation.
The Manchester Terrier is a high-spirited, very intelligent, and cunning dog who is eager to learn. He displays the true terrier nature — independent, faithful, lively, sporty, and alert. Discerning and devoted as well, a Manchester Terrier makes a loyal friend and a terrific watchdog.
Like many terriers, Manchesters have a lot of energy. They want to please and are quick learners. They are sensitive dogs, though, and can get snappy when they want to be left alone. This trait makes them unsuitable for families with small children unless the adults are willing to socialize and train their Manchester on a consistent basis.
