The Arabian horse has one of the world's longest histories, going back thousands of years; its official breed registry is the oldest in the world. Its striking beauty and even temperament have made it a popular breeding horse throughout the ages, and Arabians have contributed their elegance, spirit, and intelligence to almost every light horse breed that exists.Horse enthusiasts around the world have much for which to thank this versatile, healthy, loyal breed.
Arabian horses have lithe, compact bodies that suggest strength and speed; their heads are wedge-shaped, with refined features and a dished (concave) profile. Their backs are short, and ideally, they have sloping shoulders and powerful hindquarters. Their physical presence suggests refinement, power, agility, and elegance.
Arabians are small in stature compared to many riding horses, standing between 14 and 15.2 hands high (56 to 62 inches at the top of the shoulder). They are fine- to medium-boned and weigh from 800 to 1000 pounds. Some Arabian horses of Polish bloodlines exceed 15.3 hands high (63 inches). Selective breeding has produced both fine-boned and more robustly built Arabians, but all share the breed's general appearance and grace.
Arabian horses have taught many youngsters about the joys and responsibilities of horse ownership. Many new equestrians learn to ride on the backs of these reliable, even-keeled mounts. They are the horses of choice for long-distance trail competitions and are capable of traveling long distances over challenging terrain in intense heat. They make elegant dressage horses, provide thrills comparable to any Thoroughbred on the racetrack, and are impressive in the show ring in pleasure classes, over jumps, and in native Arabian costume classes.
